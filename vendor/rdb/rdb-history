* improvement
*** DONE need heavy investment here, pp? & ps && var -> var buffer? 
    in rdebug-varbuf x could pretty print the var
    info variables could print all variables currently available
*** DONE bt -> stack buffer 
    just let rails start debugger with annotate 3, and invoke
    script/server under rdebug, also need fix the frame buffer
    highlight color.
*** DONE ruby-debug's [n c s] already fine
*** DONE ruby-debug's down -> d <2009-12-21 Mon>
    modify the regex of command down is okay, do not know why author
    remove it (link "~/.gem/ruby/1.8/gems/ruby-debug-base-0.10.3/lib/ChangeLog" 22473)
*** TODO BUGS [5/6]
    - [X] behavior is different with and without annotation, in
      annotation mode, could not pretty print
          remove initializers/debugger.rb 
          invoke script/server withut --debug
    - [X] set break point in controller, but the first fit one in template
    - [X] when start rails server in debug mode, lots of require error
    - [X] ansi-color the output buffer
    - [X] let ruby mode debugger-server start with rdebug <2009-12-22 Tue>
    - [ ] face of variable buffer has tiny problems
