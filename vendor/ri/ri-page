Usage: ri [options] [names...]

Where name can be:

  Class | Class::method | Class#method | Class.method | method

All class names may be abbreviated to their minimum unambiguous form. If a name
is ambiguous, all valid options will be listed.

The form '.' method matches either class or instance methods, while #method
matches only instance and ::method matches only class methods.

For example:

    ri Fil
    ri File
    ri File.new
    ri zip

Note that shell quoting may be required for method names containing
punctuation:

    ri 'Array.[]'
    ri compact\!

By default ri searches for documentation in the following directories:

    /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/share/ri/1.8/system
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/share/ri/1.8/site
    /Users/bartuer/.rdoc
    /Users/bartuer/.gem/ruby/1.8/doc/*/ri
    /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/doc/*/ri
    /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/doc/*/ri

Specifying the --system, --site, --home, --gems or --doc-dir options will
limit ri to searching only the specified directories.

Options may also be set in the 'RI' environment variable.

Options:

    -f, --fmt, --format=FORMAT       Format to use when displaying output:
                                        ansi, bs, html, plain, simple
                                     Use 'bs' (backspace) with most pager
                                     programs. To use ANSI, either disable the
                                     pager or tell the pager to allow control
                                     characters.

    -d, --doc-dir=DIRNAME            List of directories from which to source
                                     documentation in addition to the standard
                                     directories.  May be repeated.

        --[no-]use-cache             Whether or not to use ri's cache.
                                     True by default.

        --no-standard-docs           Do not include documentation from
                                     the Ruby standard library, site_lib,
                                     installed gems, or ~/.rdoc.
                                     Equivalent to specifying
                                     the options --no-system, --no-site, --no-gems,
                                     and --no-home

        --[no-]system                Include documentation from Ruby's standard
                                     library.  Defaults to true.

        --[no-]site                  Include documentation from libraries
                                     installed in site_lib.
                                     Defaults to true.

        --[no-]gems                  Include documentation from RubyGems.
                                     Defaults to true.

        --[no-]home                  Include documentation stored in ~/.rdoc.
                                     Defaults to true.

        --list-doc-dirs              List the directories from which ri will
                                     source documentation on stdout and exit.

    -T, --no-pager                   Send output directly to stdout,
                                     rather than to a pager.
    -i, --interactive                This makes ri go into interactive mode.
                                     When ri is in interactive mode it will
                                     allow the user to disambiguate lists of
                                     methods in case multiple methods match
                                     against a method search string.  It also
                                     will allow the user to enter in a method
                                     name (with auto-completion, if readline
                                     is supported) when viewing a class.

    -w, --width=WIDTH                Set the width of the output.
