* Connecting To Node

The simplest way to connect to node is to simply run:

#+begin_src 
npm run swank
#+end_src

This gives you a bog standard node instance that you can interact with
using slime.

** Connecting swank.js to your own projects

It's simple, assuming that you are using NPM (and why aren't you?)
just add the following ot your package.json file:

#+begin_example
    "devDependencies": {
      "swank-js": ">=0.0.1"
    },
    "scripts": {
      "swank": "node node_modules/swank-js"
    }
#+end_example

Again, use ~npm run swank~ to start up the swank server in the context
of your project.

** TODO Maybe a deeper example here?
