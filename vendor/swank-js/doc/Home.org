* Swank.js is swank.

Welcome to the Swank.js wiki!   As a wiki it is editable by anyone (with a github account).  We encourage other people to contribute to the wiki.


swank-js provides [[http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/][Slime]] REPL and other development tools for
in-browser JavaScript and [[http://nodejs.org][Node.js]]. It consists of SWANK backend and
accompanying SLIME contrib. [[http://socket.io/][Socket.IO]] is used to communicate with wide
range of web browsers.

Currently Swank-js provides an REPL with an ability to work with multiple
browser connections, supports dynamic updates of JavaScript code using
C-c C-c / C-M-x, provides debug output function and an ability to
reload web pages in the browser or refresh their CSS using Emacs
commands.

Many aspects of full-fledged SWANK backends aren't implemented yet,
there's no debugger/completion/autodoc and so on, but as I plan to use
swank-js a lot in future there's a good chance many of these features
will be eventually added.
